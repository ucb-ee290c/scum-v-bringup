## System Overview

The SCuM-V24B chip offers several GPIO pins, a single UART bus, QSPI Flash, and an on-chip, crystal-free RTC with capture and compare registers. This iteration of the chip did not support I2C or cryptographic acceleration.

SCuM-V24B has several new features introduced over its predecessor SCuM-V22:

- 32-bit Rocket core
- Switched capacitor DC-DC converter cascaded with LDOs  
- 90 GHz FMCW radar transmitter
- 18-bit µV-precision ADC
