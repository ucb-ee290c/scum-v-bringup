== Encryption Modules

Designers: Shrey Aeron, Dang Le
Authors: Sam Xu
Bringup: TBD

Several accelerators that facilitate secure communication between two devices. 

Example use case:

1. Share key Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
2. Sender encrypts message using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and shared key
3. Receiver decrypts message using AES and shared key
4. Receiver verifies message integrity using SHA-256
