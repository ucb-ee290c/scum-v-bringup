# Radio

## Radio Architecture
The radio operates within the frequency range 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz covering 70 1MHz RF channels. The receive chain should be sensitive to an input power range of -70 dBm to -10 dBm and achieve a BER of 0.1% or an SNR of 12.5 dB.

## System Overview

The SCuM-V23 radio subsystem includes:

- **Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)**: Provides initial signal amplification
- **Mixer**: Frequency down-conversion for baseband processing
- **Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA)**: Current-to-voltage conversion
- **Bandpass Filter (BPF)**: Channel selection and filtering
- **Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)**: Adjustable signal amplification
- **Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**: Local oscillator generation

## Transmitter

The transmitter is designed to operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and be standards-compliant with IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE. The tuning range of the 4.8 GHz DCO is 4.88 GHz ± 0.5 GHz with less than 40 ppm of resolution (less than 192 kHz), corresponding to 2.44 GHz ± 0.25 GHz after the divider.

**Transmitter schematic:** The divider divides the 4.8 GHz DCO signal down to 2.4 GHz and also generates the differential in-phase and quadrature components for the mixer.
