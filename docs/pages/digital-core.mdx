# Digital Core

![Digital Core Block Diagram](/images/2023-08-18T04-45-39-595Z.png)

## Key Features

- RV32IMAFC Single Rocket Core
- 3 clocks for CPU core and peripherals:
  - 200 MHz CPU clock
  - 32 MHz ADC clock for BLE/IEEE 802.15.4 baseband-modem and precision sigma-delta ADC
  - 1MHz RTC clock
- On-chip SRAM
  - 256kB scratchpad ("L2")
  - 8kB 2 way I$ & D$
- JTAG, UART, QSPI Flash, GPIO
- Interrupt controller
  - PLIC (platform level)
  - CLINT (core level)
- RTC capture and compare peripheral

## Power Consumption

**Power consumption comparison of the core running a program with baseband register read/write and ALU usage. VCC=0.85V, CPU clock=200MHz**

| | Internal Power (mW) | Switching Power (mW) | Leakage Power (mW) | Total Power (mW) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCuM-V22 in Lab | 11.9 | - | 36 | 42.5 |
| SCuM-V24B dynamic power simulation | 7.9 | 3.2 | 0.060 | 11.2 |

Based on simulations, total power consumption of the core decreased by 73% from SCuM-V22 to SCuM-V24B. This improvement was achieved by reducing leakage power in the SRAM cells.

## Boot Process

| Method | BOOT_SEL Value | Boot Address | Interface | Boot Process Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self Boot | 1 | 0x2000_0000 | SPI | SPI flash content is copied to memory<br/>Jump to self boot base address |
| Tethered Boot | 0 | 0x0000_0000 | TSI & JTAG | 1. Boot ROM configures a trap handler, and enters a wait for interrupt loop.<br/><br/>2. Use JTAG, TSI, or other external debugging tools to program the on-chip memory<br/><br/>3. Use JTAG, TSI, or other external tools to trigger a software interrupt (MSIP)<br/><br/>4. Boot ROM handles interrupt, jumps to the program memory. |
