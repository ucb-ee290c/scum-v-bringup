==== Power Consumption

.Power consumption comparison of the core running a program with baseband register read/write and ALU usage. VCC=0.85V, CPU clock=200MHz
|===
| | Internal Power (mW) | Switching Power (mW) | Leakage Power (mW) | Total Power (mW)

| SCuM-V22 in Lab | 11.9 | | 36 | 42.5
| SCuM-V23 dynamic power simulation | 7.9 | 3.2 | 0.060 | 11.2
|===

Based on simulations, total power consumption of the core decreased by 73% from SCuM-V22 to SCuM-V23. This 
improvement was achieved by reducing leakage power in the SRAM cells.

- Core architecture
- How much memory
- How do we boot
- Where do we find simulations/programs that were run previously?
- Where is the toolchain?
- Is this the right memory map?
