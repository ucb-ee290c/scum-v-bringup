SCuM-V23 has 3 power domains:

1. VDD_A - 1V, 5mA expected
2. VDD_RF - 1V, 15mA expected
3. VDD_D - 0.85V, 15mA expected


=== Switched Capacitor Converter

Ladder 3:1 Topology

 - All capacitors & switches are rated at Vout.
 - Externally Reconfigurable for 3:1, 2:1, 3:2 for exploiting full battery voltage range.

Simulated Efficiency Variation with Load


=== Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulators 


=== Current Reference

Distributes 2 uA current reference to other blocks, includes a start-up circuit.

Parasitic extraction results:

 - Typical conditions yields reference current ranging from 1.98 uA to 2.4 uA (~20% variation)
 - Large variation with corners
 - Worst case: ff_hot at 3.04 uA

=== Bandgap Reference


=== Utility Current DAC
